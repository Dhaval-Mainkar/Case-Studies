0,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 22 June 2021,Moumita Paul,"This is such a premium looking laptop at this price point. Extremely light weight, classy looking body and keyboard, ssd boot, pre-installed windows 10, fingerprint recognition along with new features from the updated os. Everything is beautiful in both form and function. I am very satisfied with it, the packaging and even the small and compact power cable. Can't believe something so good can be available at this price point. The boot time is significantly fast than other laptops, comparable with macbook. I am techy and very nitpicky about gadget features and specifications at a given price. So this laptop is awesome in every sense!I just received it today. Will update this post if i see in any issues in the coming months."
1,4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 6 July 2021,Kesav,"Thin and light but delicate too. Bought it for 23K, so bit pricy. As Win10 has Windows Defender, no need for redundant Antivirus program. So uninstalled McAFee as it slows down entry level systems. Uninstalled Microsoft Office 365 trial copy and installed MS Office 2010. The system is working fine and smooth for daily works like Web browsing, MS Office etc.P.S  It seems this model with Celeron 4020 is putup for sale since May '21, and hence old reviews here are for earlier model GQ329 with Celeron 3350 processor.  The discontinued model was sold at around ‚Çπ 18 to 20K it seems."
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 22 May 2021,Anoopsingh,"I am using this laptop for a week and feeling so much thankful to my choice of purchase as it is working accordingly my expectations .This laptop was manufactured in Apr 21 and have great features like fingerprints 256GB ssd which gives flawless speed and having fast charging capacity although it is not full HD but still not much difference in picture quality comparatively.The most favored thing in this laptop is that is of only 21350 INR by HDFC credit EMI transaction .As I bought it for study purpose, it is one of the best laptop in this price range."
3,1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 16 August 2021,Madhu R.,"The MRP shown was around Rs. 45,000/-, as per Prime day offer the price will be around Rs. 34000/-. To avail this offer, I took the prime membership Rs. 129/-. After exchange, the price was Rs. Rs. 24,990/-. All seemed well till now. After receiving the laptop the price on the packet was Rs. 30,000/-So the whole Prime day sale, Prime Membership was all a big BS. The exchange is yet to take place.The product is good, but the Prime day sale, big discounts etc was making fool of the customers, nothing more."

¬†I received this laptop üíª two days ago.I like anti-glare display and screen quality is above average.Celeron N4020 processor is not for gaming bcz in this price range please don't expect laptops for gaming.You have given  256GB SSD M.2 NVME in just 26990 RS it's enough.This laptop is only for programming and office work.Highly recommended those  who are looking for best laptop under 30000.Build quality and look of this laptop is 4.99 out of 5.0 .One bad thing about this laptop üíª is that does not have a keyboard backlight.And I'll edit this review as I use this laptop.I hope this honest review will help many people üôè."
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 7 July 2021,Ramdevhariarjun,"Nice laptop. Writing this review after 1 week full usage.Pros:SSD laptop, so high speed performance.Booting time less than 15 seconds.Anti glare screen. So no eye strain after long online classes, particularly good for kids.Multi tasking working fine.No lagging found while surfing, attending online classes, working with acrobat, word, excel, powerpoint...Battery backup excellent, almost 6 hours nonstop usage....Cons:Camera quality average, but ok for online classes and meeting.Have to buy external hdd, since it has only 195 gb available space...Due to processor, high end gaming not possible.Verdict.Bought at 21k. If your budget around 20 to 25k and looking for online classes or for normal office works or office works, then definitely go for it.."

8,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 30 March 2022,Abhijit baidya,Read till the end.Reviewing after 12 days of usage.If your budget is around 27k and not purchasing for gaming then you should difinitely go for it. There are hardly any cons in this product.#Built quality is upto the mark.#Looks and feels premium like a 40k laptop#Fingerprint sensor is what makes it different.#Processing speed is fluent.#Camera is ok ok (enough).#Touchpad feels premium.#SSD makes it a bit more buttery.#Display quality is more than good in this budget.The only problem i faced is regarding MS office as OFFICE 365 is pre installed without the activation key as a result we cant access it or we have to purchase it. But fortunately i installed MS office 2021 from external source in minutes so not a big deal.So i would suggest everyone to go for it blindly and save some pennies without any disappointment cz i have been searching for laptop since 1 month and this fulfilled my all my requirements. Thank you

10,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 4 June 2021,Sukanta N,"It is a perfect value for money Laptop from ASUS. it is just for daily users not for gamer or edition person. I have purchased this for office work and my daughter online classes.It is really working fine. Batter life around 4-5 hrs off moderate use. Sound is good. Weight is balanced. It comes with Finger print sensor, which is fats and accurate.Don't worry about basic processor Like Intel celeron. SSD did all. Fast and smooth. U can shutdown and ON your laptop within 10 second. Restart time arround 7 second.Go for it to work moderate on daily basis.ASUS made it possible with the attractive purchase range."

14,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 18 June 2021,Suhas Mudliar,"Best configuration at this Price ‚Çπ23k.Does the job, and does it well. Bought it for my daughter's online schooling. No issues so far.Superfast booting and shut down speed. Extra wide screen, well placed key board, biggest mousepad, separate number pad on right side, fingerprint sensor.  What more you want! Integrated Graphics card is giving desired output with speed. All branded components, with no frills.Speakers are giving crystal clear sounds.Looks are good but Silver colour finish is little bit on whiter side. Looks like plastic. Very thin, and I think 'handle with card product.Overall happy with the buy."
15,4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 30 November 2021,SAL,"Features mentioned are incorrect for display  and resolution. It is not FHD it is only HD . Given resolution is incorrect . There are conflicting info given in site.There is no Micro SD card reader available in this laptop.Read only product information section.Just with windows 10 running only with edge browser open cpu is 100 % in use and memory is at 70% use. So 4 gb ram is not enough.It is as good as chrome book . Functionality and its use is very limited .Boot time is very good around 25seconds.Good for browsing , short term video 30min max due to overheating issue.Ms team or zoom is ok but long hours being online may overheat the laptop. VGA webcam , so quality cannot be expected.Ms office apps are working fine , open only one at a time . CPU will run at max always 2.8ghz..no room to expand.Unable to upgrade to windows 11 , keeps telling to download and install but never happens. No error and nothing works. Windows 10 updated and works fine."
16,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 1 November 2021,Shubham Kumar,"I'm using this laptop since 4 months. My experience with it has been very satisfying. First of all, would like to say thanks to Amazon for fast delivery and good packaging. Coming to the laptop, it is a good laptop.The screen is good, clarity is nice despite HD only resolution. The speakers sound loud and with audio enhancement inbuilt, the sound is crisp. Ideal for watching movies. It is running Celeron processor which is meant for basic tasks but surprisingly coupled with 256GB SSD, normal tasks such as browsing, reading, document editing with Office feels smooth. But remember it isn't for gaming or heavy tasks. Battery life been great due to power efficient Celeron processor. Earlier I used Core i5 10th gen, although it was powerful but battery life wasn't that great. My usage is light with some browsing, content consumption and editing documents which this laptop serves without breaking a sweat. The fingerprint scanner is nice addition which I find very useful. No need to input pin everytime to unlock. Scanner response is pretty good. Front camera is okay if there's sufficient light in the room as you'd find in this budget. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase."

19,1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 8 October 2021,Prem maheshwarkar,"This laptop sucks. No doubt what did I expect after purchasing a ASUS. The laptop does remarkable job to representing the company name, quality and service.  My laptop sporadically stops working for no good reason not even after a month I bought it. Not recommended if you want mental peace. Very dissappointed"
20,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 22 March 2022,ujjwal,"I was sceptical to buy Celeron processor but I bought this because it has M.2 ssd which means laptop SSD speed is high and it's turning on in 5 secs. It has 2.8ghz processor which is also enough if you're a everyday laptop user or even you can do low to mid level programming like Java, python they can run smoothly so go for it if you're looking for a laptop which is under 30k.Also, i played 4k videos on YouTube and it was running smoothly.If you a Bca or b tech student and you don't have high budget you can go for it will serve you enough.Cons :-Maximum RAM you can upgrade is 8 gb."

28,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 8 July 2021,Amazon Customer,"This product is very outstanding if you're looking for a pc for either home,school or college use. Even though product comes with intel celeron processor, it does the job with the help of ssd. Boot up time, battery, picture, fingerprint and sound quality are very good. Awesome design as well. You cannot do gaming. Expanding the ram and ssd would fasten the system. It is light weight and useful for general browsing, home and office works, watching movies etc."
29,4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 5 July 2021,Sumanta Majumdar,"I had an urgent requirement for a regular use laptop for my sister and searched amazon to find this one.Really very good deal under 23k since you are getting 256ssd for this price along with upgradable memory which originally is 4gb out of the box.Overall quality is good with quality speakers and good enough screen even though it is not full HD. But overall specs are also par for the course considering the price and brand of ASUS.But dont expect gaming in this laptop since after all it a celeron processor.I was pleasantly surprised to see a fingerprint sensor which in today's world, laptops costing 3 times more than this dont even provide. So kudos to ASUS for that."
